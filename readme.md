## Why FLUX?

This project was created as a learning exercise for Rust development, focusing on:
- CLI design principles
- File I/O operations
- Data structures and error handling
- Building a complete application from scratch

It's not meant to replace full-featured task managers, but rather to demonstrate core Rust concepts in a practical application.
