# FLUX

A simple command-line task manager built with Rust 🦀  
Made for learning purposes – lightweight, file-based, and cross-platform.

---

## What it does
- Create and manage multiple users  
- Add, view, delete, and update tasks  
- Mark tasks as **done** or **pending**  
- Search through tasks quickly  
- Show basic task statistics  
- Stores everything in plain text files (I/O based)

---

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.70+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Why this project?

This project is mainly for **learning Rust**:

- Practicing CLI design  
- File I/O handling  
- Structs & enums for tasks  
- Error handling & validation  

It’s not meant to replace big task managers – just a fun way to practice Rust! 🚀
